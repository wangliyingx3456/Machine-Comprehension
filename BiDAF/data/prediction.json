cpdna were performed , scientists did notice linear structures ; however , they attributed these linear forms to broken circles . if the branched and complex structures seen in cpdna experiments are real and not artifacts of concatenated circular dna or broken circles , then a d-loop mechanism of replication is insufficient to explain how those structures would replicate . at the same time , homologous recombination does not expand the multiple a -- > g gradients seen in plastomes . because of the failure to explain the deamination gradient as well as the numerous plant species that have

c4 photosynthesis . the four-carbon compound is then transported to the bundle sheath chloroplasts , where it drops off co2 and returns to the mesophyll . bundle sheath chloroplasts do not carry out

imports from non-member states , duties between member states are prohibited , and imports circulate freely . in addition under the treaty on the functioning of the european union article 34 , \u2018 quantitative restrictions on imports and all measures having equivalent effect shall be prohibited between member states \u2019 . in procureur du roi v dassonville the court of justice held that this rule meant all \" trading rules \" that are \" enacted by member states \" which could hinder trade \" directly or indirectly , actually or potentially \" would be caught by article 34 . this meant that a belgian law requiring scotch whisky imports to have a certificate of origin was unlikely to be lawful . it discriminated against parallel importers like mr dassonville , who could not get certificates from authorities in france , where they bought the scotch . this \" wide test \" , to determine what could potentially be an unlawful restriction on trade , applies equally to actions by quasi-government bodies , such as the former \" buy irish \" company that had government appointees . it also means states can be responsible for private actors . for instance , in commission v france french farmer vigilantes were continually sabotaging shipments of spanish strawberries , and even belgian tomato imports . france was liable for these hindrances to trade because the authorities \u2018 manifestly and persistently abstained ' from preventing the sabotage . generally speaking , if a member state has laws or practices that directly discriminate against imports ( or exports under tfeu article 35 ) then it must be justified under article 36 . the justifications include public morality , policy or security , \" protection of health and life of humans , animals or plants \" , \" national treasures \" of \" artistic , historic or archaeological value \" and \" industrial and commercial property . \" in addition , although not clearly listed , environmental protection can justify restrictions on trade as an overriding requirement derived from tfeu article 11 . more generally , it has been increasingly acknowledged that fundamental human rights should take priority over all trade rules . so , in schmidberger v austria the court of justice held that austria did not infringe article 34 by failing to ban a protest that blocked heavy traffic passing over the a13 , brenner autobahn , en route to italy . although many companies , including mr schmidberger 's german undertaking , were prevented from trading , the court of justice reasoned that freedom of association is one of the \u2018 fundamental pillars of a democratic society \u2019 , against which the free movement of goods had to be balanced", "5726b929f1498d1400e8e8ec": "motorcycles or mopeds

democratic deficit \" under the treaties is usually thought to be that completion integration of the european economy and political institutions required the technical coordination of experts , while popular understanding of the eu developed and nationalist sentiments declined post-war . over time , this has meant the parliament gradually assumed more voice : from being an unelected assembly , to its first direct elections in 1979 , to having increasingly more rights in the legislative process . citizens ' rights are therefore limited compared to the democratic polities within all european member states : under teu article 11 citizens and associations have the rights such as publicising their views and submit an initiative that must be considered by the commission with one million signatures . tfeu article 227 contains a further right for citizens to petition the parliament on issues which affect them . parliament elections , take place every five years , and votes for members of the european parliament in member states must be organised by proportional representation or a single transferable vote . there are 750 meps and their numbers are \" degressively proportional \" according to member state size . this means - although the council is meant to be the body representing member states - in the parliament citizens of smaller member states have more voice than citizens in larger member states . meps divide , as they do in national parliaments , along political party lines : the conservative european people 's party is currently the largest , and the party of european socialists leads the opposition . parties do not receive public funds from the eu , as the court of justice held in parti \u00e9cologiste \" les verts \" v parliament that this was entirely an issue to be regulated by the member states . the parliament 's powers include calling inquiries into maladministration or appoint an ombudsman pending any court proceedings . it can require the commission respond to questions and by a two-thirds majority can censure the whole commission ( as happened to the santer commission in 1999 ) . in some cases , the parliament has explicit consultation rights , which the commission must genuinely follow . however its role participation in the legislative process still remains limited because no member can actually or pass legislation
